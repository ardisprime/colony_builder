# NAMING CONVENTION #
The naming convention is camelCase following c++ standards.

Branch names have 2 parts split by a "/", the first one is a general category and the second
is a short descriptive name, ie graphics/renderer, core/readme.

# COMPILING AND RUNNING #
To run Tests and Application, issue a "make" command in the root directory of the repo.
If just running Tests, a "make test" command has to be used.
And if just running Application, issue a "make run" command.

Repository is automatically compiled.

# TESTS #
Put tests in the main function in the test.cpp file.
The test(bool) function is used to check a condition and exit the program if the condition is false.
Using this tests can be written like test( (1+1) == 2) to test if 1 + 1 is equal to 2.
Its recommended to add short messages to the console, printing out information about the test,
to know what has failed.
